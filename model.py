In this project, we implemented a naive approach to face recognition as an initial step toward building a functional system. 
At this stage, the focus was not on optimizing the model, but rather on achieving a working version capable of performing inference. 
The goal was to validate the core functionality and establish a solid foundation for future improvements.

We will use the WIDERFACE Dataset: http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/ from Yang Shou
And for training and test, for first, we will use the .txt files provided by them, that select images for training and testing.
