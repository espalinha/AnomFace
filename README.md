# AnomFace
## Introduction
"This repository is the result of my undergraduate research project and aims to develop an efficient and high-accuracy algorithm for facial recognition and anonymization.

I intend to use PyTorch to implement my own DenseNet architecture. In addition, I plan to apply optimizations to reduce the modelâ€™s computational cost and use JAX to further enhance performance."
